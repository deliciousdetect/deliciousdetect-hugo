Some time in October 2014 I checked out Damn the Weather in Seattle’s Pioneer
Square. This was obviously before it was featured as a "Best new restaurant"
in Seattle Magazine.

Here’s what you need to know:
The ice cubes there are from another planet. They are melted from the bottom up,
I shit you not. These cubes will make your cocktail experience one to remember
for a long time.

Food:
I had the sandwich with the egg placed into the bread itself. You want this.
Grilled romaine salad was pretty Damn Tasty too.

I was feeling hungry and adventurous, so after we left here we set out for
Kedai Makan on Capitol Hill.
