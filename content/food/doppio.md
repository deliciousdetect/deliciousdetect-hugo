This is a nice coffee shop in Hood River, Oregon with high ceilings, and plenty
of indoor and outdoor seating. The wifi is strong and plenty fast enough for my needs.

Itâ€™s even right next to a sweet water fountain that dogs and kids like to cool off
in on hot days. Check out this place if you are looking for a good coffee
shop experience in Hood River.
Doppio is right next to the Hood River Distillery tasting room. The tasting room
was still being built out when I was there so it was not open for business yet.
Something to check out on my next visit to Hood River!
