Always on the lookout for the best food experiences, my search brought me to
Orlando, Florida of all places. On a gorgeous May evening I arrived to one of
the best food truck rodeos I'd experienced in a long time! #TastyTuesday! Three
cool bars are all next to each other and they have a large variety of craft beer
and cocktails to enjoy with whatever food trucks catch your eye in the back
parking lot. I highly recommend checking this out if you are in Orlando or
visiting!  

Search for "Tasty Tuesdays in the Milk District" on Facebook to find
the upcoming schedule and location. Just remember all the action is hidden
in the back, so don't worry if you are in the right place. You will have a
great time!
