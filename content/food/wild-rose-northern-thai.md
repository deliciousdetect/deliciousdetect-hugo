While in Bend I made sure to check out Wild Rose Northen Thai Eats for lunch.
The place was full even at 12:30. I was lucky to find a seat at the bar!

I had their most well known lunch item, Khao Soi Curry. Egg noodles red onion and
pickled cabbage in a coconut curry broth topped with fried crispy egg noodles,
cilantro and lime. I had it with the tofu and it was really good!

I really recommend Wild Rose if you are in Bend.
